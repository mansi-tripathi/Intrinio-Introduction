#### a.	Pricing
Intrinio was built on the principle that everyone should have access to exactly the data they need when they need it. That’s why their pricing structure might be a little different than you’re used to (especially if you’re “used to” paying hundreds of thousands of dollars every year for data).
Their customers aren’t all the same, so they don’t sell one-size-fits-all solutions. 
This section talks about the various pricing options available based on your requirements.
Choose the enterprise, startup, or individual options below to learn about our pricing structure.

The “Enterprise” and “ Start-up” include Subscription Financial data (contains API Data Feeds), One-Time Financial Data (contains Bulk Downloads) and Custom Financial data (Built to order) while the “Individual” option consists of just the former two options.
